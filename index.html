      <h2>Chapter One — You</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t think you realize how much you mean to me, so I wanted to put it
        into words — even though words will probably never be enough. From the
        very beginning, you’ve been someone who changed my days without even trying.
        Your smile has this quiet way of making everything feel okay, even when
        nothing else is.
      </p>

      <h2>Chapter Two — Us</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve had moments where everything felt easy, where laughing with you felt
        natural and loving you felt effortless. But we’ve also had moments that
        weren’t so easy — moments where we misunderstood each other, where things
        felt heavy, or where we both had to grow in ways we didn’t expect.

    <section class="page">
      <h2>Chapter Three — Choosing Love</h2>
      <p>
        Loving you hasn’t been about perfection. It’s been about choosing each
        other — even on the days when things feel messy, confusing, or hard.
        I’ve learned that love isn’t fragile. It’s strong, forgiving, and willing
        to grow.

        “Above all, love each other deeply.”<br>

      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="page">
      <h2>Chapter Four — Always</h2>
      <p>
        You’ve seen me at my best and at my worst, and somehow you’re still here.
        That means more to me than you’ll ever know.
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        And if I had to choose again, in every lifetime, in every version of this
        world…<br>
        <strong>I’d still choose you.</strong> 💕🙏
